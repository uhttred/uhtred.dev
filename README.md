# Fullstack Website as Open Source (uhtred.dev, the frontend)

This repository is part of the emu personal website which is now open source. You can use this repository along with the other resources I left open however you want. Alter, remodel, resell, use as a base for your projects, etc.

The project is a website for publishing materials, series of articles, selling digital products, etc... made with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/), initially hosted on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/). There is currently an adapted version hosted on [render.com](https://render.com/), you can [access it here](https://uhtred-dev.onrender.com/).

Here is a list of the main features. Use them however you want.

Use the username `manager` and password `asdasdasd` to access the [administrative portal](https://api-uhtred-dev.onrender.com/admin/) in render. Feel free to add more records, but do not change this user's password or username.

You need to be a mid-level developer, at least, to be able to understand the repositories and get them running locally.

Unfortunately I will not be providing support for this project, all repositories and resources will be as is as read-only files.
